# Embedded Motor Control

DC motor control logic developed as part of a first semester embedded systems group project.

My contribution focused on motor control, including PWM-based speed control and
direction handling using an Arduino-compatible platform.

Other parts of the system (sensors, sound, and overall integration) were developed
by other group members and are not included in this repository.
